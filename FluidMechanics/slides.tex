\frametitle{What is Fluid Mechanics?}
Fluid mechanics is the study of fluids (liquids, gases, plasmas, squishy things) and their interactions with forces. Continuum mechanics is a generalization of the principles of fluid mechanics that does not focus on matter, and may be used to model the behavior of non-matter phenomena that nonetheless behave like fluids, e\.g\. heat.
